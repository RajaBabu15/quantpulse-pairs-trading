## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. Please follow these guidelines when reporting security issues:

### 📧 How to Report
**Do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@quantpulse.example.com`
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the [private vulnerability reporting feature](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quantpulse-pairs-trading/security/advisories)

```

### ⏰ Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within:

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment and triage
- **7 days**: Detailed analysis and fix timeline
- **30 days**: Security patch release (for confirmed vulnerabilities)

### 🔒 Confidentiality

We request that you:
- **Keep the vulnerability confidential** until we release a fix
- **Do not publicly disclose** the issue before coordinated disclosure
- **Avoid accessing or modifying** user data beyond what's necessary to demonstrate the issue

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: Code is analyzed with Bandit for security issues
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular checks for vulnerable dependencies using Safety
- **Code Reviews**: All changes undergo security-focused code review
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation

### Data Protection
- **No Data Collection**: QuantPulse processes financial data locally
- **No Network Transmission**: Trading strategies run entirely offline
- **Memory Safety**: C++ code uses modern RAII patterns and smart pointers
- **Secure Defaults**: Conservative default configurations

### Build Security
- **Reproducible Builds**: Deterministic build process with version pinning
- **Supply Chain**: Dependencies verified and pinned to specific versions
- **CI/CD Security**: Automated security scanning in build pipeline
- **Signed Releases**: Release artifacts are cryptographically signed

## 🔍 Known Security Considerations

### Financial Data Sensitivity
QuantPulse processes sensitive financial data. Users should:
- **Isolate Trading Environment**: Run in dedicated environments
- **Secure Data Storage**: Encrypt financial data at rest
- **Network Isolation**: Avoid running on shared or public networks
- **Access Control**: Limit access to trading systems and data

### C++ Memory Safety
Our C++ components follow security best practices:
- **No Raw Pointers**: Use smart pointers and RAII patterns
- **Bounds Checking**: Array access is bounds-checked where possible
- **Integer Overflow**: Careful handling of arithmetic operations
- **Compiler Flags**: Built with security-enhancing compiler flags

### Python Security
- **Pickle Avoidance**: No use of Python pickle for data serialization
- **Input Validation**: All external inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and vulnerability monitoring
- **Execution Environment**: Recommendations for secure Python environments

## 🏆 Security Credits

We appreciate security researchers and will acknowledge contributions:

### Hall of Fame
*When we receive our first security reports, we'll list contributors here (with their permission).*

### Recognition
- **Public acknowledgment** in release notes and security advisories

## 📋 Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation Security
```bash
# Always install from official sources
pip install quantpulse-pairs-trading

# Verify package integrity (when available)
pip install quantpulse-pairs-trading --verify-signature

# Use virtual environments
python -m venv quantpulse-env
source quantpulse-env/bin/activate
```

### Runtime Security
```python
# Validate input data
import quantpulse

def secure_trading_session():
    # Use type hints and validation
    data = load_market_data()  # Your secure data loading
    
    # Validate data integrity
    if not validate_market_data(data):
        raise ValueError("Invalid market data detected")
    
    # Run with proper error handling
    try:
        results = quantpulse.run_backtest(data)
        return results
    except Exception as e:
        log_security_event(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        raise
```

### Environment Security
- **Isolated Environment**: Run trading code in dedicated virtual machines
- **Firewall Rules**: Block unnecessary network access
- **File Permissions**: Restrict access to trading data and logs
- **Monitoring**: Log and monitor all trading activity
